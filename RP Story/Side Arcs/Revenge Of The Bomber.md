It all began when Mango M tried to grab "Rebarx" to take her to the Anti Star. J and the PWD( who would eventually become Master D) chased them, but PWD wasn't quite able to get enough height, so he used Bomber as a trampoline. Unfortunately, this was the LAST STRAW for the Bomber, for it had blown up one too many times that day. Infuriated, it set out on a quest to MURDER this PWD, and get as much revenge as possible. 

Along the way, it met Chemitory, but after a long battle, failed to get either of his Code Cubes (one went to Blatzy, and one went to Holo Defense.) Despite this, he formed an alliance with the Chemitory, along with a Walky and a Rocky, in order to get their collective "revenge." They then recruited "Rebarx" and Lightness, but only temporarily, despite the fact everyone involved had their own revenges. 

Around this time is when they started to meet up with PWD again, who kept making swift escapes. Eventually, he got a bit overzealous with his escapes, and ended up crashing through an unknown building. However, he decided he would make the most of it, and defined a new identity for himself by picking up a cape, headband, glasses, and green paint. This defined him to be Master D. To be continued...
