Shotzos are a silent, immobile, mechanical specimen. Moto Shotzos are a modified version of them with wheels and a more movable barrel.

Original Shotzos cannot speak or move. The only thing they can do is aim and fire in 5 directions. Moto Shotzos can move around, but also cannot speak to living beings unless modified. They will temporarily revert if touching rainbow gunk. 

Shotzos are completely indestructible, but Moto Shotzos are not. Original ones also have a faster firing rate. Moto Shotzos have a cockpit which other beings can enter in an emergency, and have been known to protect other robots with this. Both can fire either clouds of smoke or **balls** out of their barrel.
