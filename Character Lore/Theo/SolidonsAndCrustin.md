"Don't crush me, please!"

Solidons are wide, flat blocks of dirt with small, beady eyes. They are usually seen hiding inside the ground, or gliding through the air. They are known to have extreme mood swings, one moment they'll be violently slamming you into the ground and the next they'll be shivering in a corner.

(idk the rest yet lol)

"Let's get some fresh air."

Crustin is a larger version of a Solidon, though she has darker skin and hair, the latter of which is almost always in a ponytail. She often thinks of herself as a mother or queen to the smaller Solidons. Like her "children", she is very much prone to mood swings. Due to her lack of a mouth, she can usually only eat by absorbing energy through sunbeams or her roots, the latter of which can extend out of her body. 

She can create circle-saws of leaves in an emergency, along with extending a root and absorbing the energy of whatever it touches. She can also create prehensile vines, which can warp around objects and grab them, functioning as arms. When she's out of energy, her hair turns a bright orange. Most notably, she can retract her limbs and face, or hide underground, appearing as a regular stone. She can also glide through the air and run extremely fast.
