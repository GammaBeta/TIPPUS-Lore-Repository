"WHOOPS!!!"

Bomber is a peaceful but unobservant resident of Dream Land, in fact one of the most popular and iconic ones. There may be more than one.

If it falls over, it is 100% going to explode. If it somehow doesn't, something such as a falling rock will almost always rectify this. If it falls far enough, it can explode with enough power to shatter the entire planet/server!

Bomber and TAC are the only known residents of the Copy Planet.

It is known to hold grudges a VERY long time, for a certain one has walked all the way to Rainbow Resort and back just to find a Parasol Waddle Dee.

STATUS: Searching the entirety of Popstar for Master D, with his unnamed Squad.
