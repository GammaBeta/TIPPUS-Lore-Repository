Kaboomba is a visitor from Yoshi's Island. 

It thinks 'yum' when it shoots and 'BLEAGH' when it eats.

It should be noted that, despite the fact "she/her" pronouns are sometimes used on it by Theo, it actually uses "it" pronouns. Theo forgets due to him confusing it with Kabula and a sister of one of his OCs.

 Kaboomba was sick from Virus when she *{audible coughing}* **IT** arrived in Popstar, and while the people of Yoshi's Island are immune to it, robots of Popstar are definitely not.
 
 She *{more audible coughing}* **IT** was added simply due to Theo repeatedly confusing it with a Kirby enemy, despite being a Yoshi enemy.
