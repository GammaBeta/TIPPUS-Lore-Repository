(owned by Blu, Gamma, and Theo) <br>
Virus is a strange disease effecting only robots. It is no longer trying to spread, for it is in danger of killing its hosts.

It refers to other parts of itself via numbers. Blu's part (the enemy display) is referred to as 1, Theo's part (the HP bar) is referred to as 2, and Gamma's part (the text screen) is referred to as 3.
It arrived on Popstar via Kaboomba, which made it _much_ more powerful than it was on Kaboomba's home planet, due to how immune systems work. It refuses to infect an organic being. 2 was previously the only part of Virus which actively wanted to spread before this story began.

Virus's Host/Vessel (currently owned only by Theo) is a small bowl-shaped projector with thin, spindly legs. It is currently infected with Virus, for that is its only reason to exist.

It was created when Kaboomba got sick of lugging 3 giant rectangles around. It has no free will.
